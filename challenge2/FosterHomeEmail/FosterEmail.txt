Happy Caturday friends,

Here is the latest list of cats and kittens needs homes and the beginning
of their second chance at a forever home :)

I have two very urgent, very special cats needing homes today. Both are
more challenging than normal but sweet cats that just need a little extra
TCR love and patience. These both are very critical moves needed this
weekend, we are out of options for both of them. I hope that someone in
our family can help these cats out.

Rumi  5 yrs M - CRITICAL MOVE!!!

Rumi is named after the poet because of his long and pensive moods and
stares. He is extremely docile and will position himself beside you
as you read a book or watch t.v. He is not afraid of loud noises or
children. His favourite time is meal time during which he will be too
absorbed to notice you giving him his insulin shots. His diabetes is a
minor side note to this sweet boy with a big personality.

He has diabetes. He needs 1 units of Lantus twice daily (injections). Each
at meal times. A quarter of a cup of dry food and a quarter of a tin
of wet food for each meal. Lots of water. Insulin MUST be given when
heâ€™s eating or after food. We will support you in any way we can and
will provide the insulin and food needed

Dominic (Doom) 5yr old MN

He is very sweet and playful kitty and is a good guy. But he MUST be
in a single cat home. Right now he is territorial peeing with the other
cats in the home so needs to be on is own. Would someone be willing to
give this boy a chance?

The entire list can also be found here

Thank you all very much and please let me know if you can help us today,
