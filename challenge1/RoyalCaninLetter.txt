Dear Adopter, 

I'm writing to you as you have recently adopted a cat from Toronto Cat
Rescue. We are so grateful to you for opening your home to a cat in
need of a warm and loving home. Without you, there would be far more
cats with no future!

We have a corporate sponsor, Royal Canin, who provides us with food
for our foster cats. This helps more than 200 foster homes take in cats
awaiting adoption.

The Royal Canin program works by us providing to them information about
adopters. We would provide them with your name and your email address.
They will email you with information about Royal Canin food and specials.
You can unsubscribe at anytime.

We would like to provide your information. If you do not want your
name and email address shared with Royal Canin, please reply to this
email and we will ensure your information is not sent.  We care about
your privacy and never sell your information, and we never share your
information without your permission.

Thank you again for opening your home and your heart to a Toronto Cat
Rescue cat!

Warmest regards,
